# Timeline

Phase 1 (Current phase):

This is the eary phase of development, pre-release wasn't to be published to public due to some issues in the software. This phase is the official release's earliest stage of development, and is still at its most basic form. Will have bugs, don't expect stability. All releases will be marked as pre-release, up untill version 1.3.223

Phase 2: (Almost here)

This phase gives the release more stability, and is still in a basic format. the software will be for regular usage, but not a real replacement, as it will sill lack features of regular environments, but will get the job done. Bug support will stay untill Phase 3 builds start rolling

Phase 3: 

This is the final phase in early developments, and is the most stable of early builds. This should be the most rock solid of early builds. Official build stages will be added here as time goes on

Regular: 

The last and more official part of development, features wil lbe expanded and added, making it better than your cmd.exe. Development will fall into a regular cycle, with 2 official short term releases with help on the wikis and bug patches. Every 2 years, there will be a long term release, with 5 years worth of technical support and bug patches. 

**Release versioning will change to:
xx.yy.zzz.PATCHNUM CODENAME** 
Starting at Phase 2 development!
