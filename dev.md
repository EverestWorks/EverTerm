#Timeline:

Phase 1 (Current phase):
This is the eary phase of development, pre-release wasn't to be published to public due to some issues in the software. This phase is the official release's earliest stage of development, and is still at its most basic form.

Phase 2: 
This phrase gives the release more stability, and is still in a basic format. the software will be for serious usage, as it contains features that will make it more useful than phase 1 builds.

Phase 3: 
This is the final phase in early developments, and is the most stable of early builds. This will be the most rock solid of early builds. Official build stages will be added here as time goes on
