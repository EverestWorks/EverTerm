This is the linux side of the code, which should involve more linux type commends

Prerequistes:

python (depends if you have it, so sudo may be needed)
pip (depends if you have it, so sudo may be needed)
a linux distro with a terminal
pyinstaller (install with pip, no sudo needed)
hands (gonna need sudo)
keyboard (just get one, no sudo needed)

if any of these isn't present, please install it
