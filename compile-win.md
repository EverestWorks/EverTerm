======================================

To compile, you need:
Windows with Python in the PATH, 
Brain, 
Hands, 
CMD.exe


======================================


If you do not have the pyinstaller or py2exe mmodule(s), install with the command: 
`pip install pyinstaller` or `pip install py2exe`

Once pyinstaller is ready, download the source with either
`gh repo clone EverestWorks/EverTerm` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!


======================================


`gh repo clone EverestWorks/Everest-Tools` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!
Then change your directory to the source
Use the pyinstaller command as: 
`pyinstaller -i icon.ico evtm.py` in the src directory
Use py2exe as:
'python setup.py py2exe' in the src directory
