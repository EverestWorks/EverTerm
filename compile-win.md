======================================

To compile, you need:
Windows with Python fully set up(runable from the source)
Brain, 
Hands, 
CMD.exe


======================================


If you do not have the pyinstaller or  install with the command: 
`pip install pyinstaller` or 

Once pyinstaller is ready, download the source with either
`gh repo clone EverestWorks/EverTerm` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!


Then change your directory to the source
Use the pyinstaller command as: 
`pyinstaller -i icon.ico evtm.py` in the src directory
