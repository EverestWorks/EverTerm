If you do not have the pyinstaller or py2exe mmodule(s), install with the command: 
`pip install pyinstaller` or `pip install py2exe`

Once pyinstaller is ready, download the source with either
`gh repo clone EverestWorks/Everest` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!

`gh repo clone EverestWorks/Everest-Tools` or `git clone https://github.com/EverestWorks/Everest-Tools.git` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!
Then change your directory to the source
Use the pyinstaller command as: 
`pyinstaller -i icon.ico evtm.py` in the src directory
Use py2exe as:
'python setup.py py2exe' in the src directory

Linux is getting a binary soon, please hang tight guys!!
