If you do not have the pyinstaller or py2exe mmodule(s), install with the command:

Once pyinstaller is ready, download the source with either
`gh repo clone EverestWorks/Everest` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!

Then change your directory to the source
Use the pyinstaller command as: 
`pyinstaller -i icon.ico evtm.py` in the src directory
