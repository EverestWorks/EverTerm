======================================

If you do not have the pyinstaller module, install with the command: 
`pip install pyinstaller`

Once pyinstaller is ready, download the source with either
`gh repo clone MultiOSDev/Everest-Tools` or `git clone https://github.com/MultiOSDev/Everest-Tools.git` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!
Then change your directory to the source
Use the pyinstaller command as: 
`pyinstaller -F -i [icon.ico] [file.py]`

Replace [icon.ico] with the icon that matches the file name of [file.py]
Replace [file.py] with the python file you wish to compile

To compile all, run the compileall.bat located in the compile directory, or run the batch file of the python file you want to compile(PYINSTALLER MUST BE INSTALLED AND IN SCRIPTS DIRECTORY, AND SCRIPTS FOLDER HAS TO BE IN PATH!)
