This is the linux side of the code, which should involve more linux type commends

Prerequistes:

python (depends if you have it, so sudo may be needed)
pip (depends if you have it, so sudo may be needed)
an arch based distro or debian
pyinstaller (install with pip, no sudo needed)
hands (gonna need sudo)
keyboard (just get one, no sudo needed)

if any of these isn't present, please install it
