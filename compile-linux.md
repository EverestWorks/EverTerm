======================================

To compile, you need:
Linux OS with python fully setup, pip (if you dont have pyinstaller)

Brain,

Hands, 

terminal,

gh (install with your package manager if not present)


======================================


If you do not have the pyinstaller, install with the command: 
`pip install pyinstaller` 

Once pyinstaller is ready, download the source with either
`gh repo clone EverestWorks/EverTerm` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!
If GH not installed, go to https://cli.github.com

======================================


`gh repo clone EverestWorks/Everest-Tools` (Alert me if it doesn't work)!
Then change your directory to the source
Use the pyinstaller command as: 
`pyinstaller -i icon.ico evtm.py` in the src directory
once it completes, go into dist and into the folder inside and run `./evtm` after `chmod +x ./evtm`
